# Gishushu-Trafic-Lights
The traffic light system alternates between North-South and East-West green, yellow, and red lights with transition delays, also incorporating pedestrian crossing states with red lights in all directions. An emergency override mode causes all lights to flash red until the emergency is cleared, then resumes normal operation.
